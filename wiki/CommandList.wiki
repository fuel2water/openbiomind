List of !OpenBiomind commands:

   * EnhanceDataset: adds "synthetic" or "enhanced" features to datasets based on the match of the genes in the dataset to existing gene and protein ontologies. In other words, it is a way to enrich the dataset using systematized domain knowledge.
   * DatasetTransformer: used for dividing a given dataset into validation folds and selection of features more relevant to the classification problem at hand.
   * MetaTask: executes a large number of non-deterministic classification experiments (or _tasks_) over the same dataset.
   * UtilityComputer: computes the utility of genes (as well as enhanced features) based on they frequency across a large number of classification models (generated by a metatask).
   * ClusteringTransformer: generates clustering datasets using as inputs either categorial datasets or large numbers of classification models (again, those generated by a metatask).
   * [http://code.google.com/p/openbiomind/wiki/Clusterize Clusterize]: clustering using Omniclust, !OpenBiomind's simple clustering algorithm.
   * ViewClusters: clustering visualization in classic raster image view.
   * GraphFeatures: portrays relations (of co-expression, co-occurrence in models) among genes (and enhanced features) in a graph visualization, displaying also several other kinds of related information.
   * CompletePipeline: runs all the processes above over a categorial dataset, in a coordinated way, channeling outputs of some commands as inputs of others.
   * [FoldSelectSnps FoldSelectSNPs]: converts a SNP dataset into a float-coded version divided in folds and feature-selected - that is, ready for metatasks.

Note: in all commands above, the _openbiomind-bin_x.xx.jar_ executable (often called simply openbiomind.jar for sake of simplicity and version-independence), as well as the _pipeline.properites_ file and the _datafiles_ directory present at the extras package, are assumed to be in the classpath. Indeed often openbiomind.jar is evoked explicitly in the command line for sake of emphasis.

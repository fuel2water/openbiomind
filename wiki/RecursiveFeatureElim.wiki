The RecursiveFeatureElim command allows the user to run many classification experiments (called _MetaTasks_ in !OpenBiomind lingo) on a given dataset folding, in which the reduced feature-set that is derived from every round of MetaTask performed is ''re-transforms'' the data-set folding. Therefore, the process selects recursively for the most utilized gene features in each round of classification, such it may come up with the most important feature-set in the end. 

It follows the syntax below:

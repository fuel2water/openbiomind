The RecursiveFeatureElim command allows the user to run many classification experiments (called _tasks_ in !OpenBiomind lingo) on a given dataset folding, in which the reduced feature-set that is derived from every round of MetaTask performed is ''re-transforms'' the data-set folding. Therefore, the process selects recursively for the most utilized gene features in each round of classification, such it may come up with the most important feature-set in the end. 

It follows the syntax below:


{{{
java task.RecursiveFeatureElim <-f fold directory> <-d base dataset> <-o outpath> [-numberOfTasks number of tasks] [-targetCategory case category] [-classificationMethod snpga|boolsimple|snplocal|snp|conventional|boolcomplex] [-n number of trials] [-e cut off percentage]
}}}


Notes:

   *-d specifies the original file containing the original dataset and gene-oncology information. 
   *-f specifies the path of a directory containing train/test dataset pairs, in the way of DatasetTransformer.
   *-o  specifies a valid directory where the RFE trials and their respective metatask output results will be stored.
   *-numberOfTasks specifies the number of single tasks in a given metatask round to be run. (Default value 3 from _pipeline.properties_ is assumed if option is ommited.)
   * _-targetCategory_  is the name of the case category in the datasets. (Default value CASE from _pipeline.properties_ is assumed if option is ommited.)
   * _-classificationMethod_ specifies the technique used for generating a classification model (see !MetaTask for more detailed information on each classification method.)
   *_-n_ specifies the number of RFE trials to be ran. This is different from numberOfTasks as numberOfTasks specify the tasks to be run in a single RFE trial. Users may wish to run multiple RFE trials as to get the best reduced feature-set as RFE process can be quite stochastic. 
   *_-e_ specifies the RFE feature selection cut-off rate, that is after a single metatask round; what percentile of features utilized by the last metatask round will be used for the next round of RFE (i.e., 90% cut-off-rate denotes that 90% of the top utilized genes will be selected for next round).

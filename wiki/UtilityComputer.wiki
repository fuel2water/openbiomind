Utility computation is an OpenBiomind processes that estimates the utility of features (say, genes) in a dataset by accounting their frequencies of occurrency of large numbers of models (as those generated by a metatask).

The !UtilityComputer command has the following syntax:

{{{
java task.UtilityComputer <-r result dir> <-o output file> <-d base dataset> [-targetCategory target category]
}}}

, where:

   * _result dir_ is a directory containing metatask results (generated by OpenBiomindMetaTask).
   * _output file_ is the name of the file where the important feature tables will be saved.
   * _base dataset_ is the dataset originally used by the metatask that generated _result dir_ . In the case of a metatask using folding, the original dataset is the one submitted to folding by OpenBiomindDatasetTransformer . In the case of a metatask using a train-test pair, the train dataset should be the one used in this command.
   * _target category_ is the case category as used in the metatask.

The output file is in a tabular format following the line structure below:

{{{
feature [tab] feature utility [tab] utility rank [tab] diff rank [tab] SAM rank [tab] feature description
}}}

, where:

   * _feature utility_ is the percent of models in the metatask results using _feature_ . Accordingly, _utility rank_ is determined by that metric.
   * _diff rank_ is the rank of the _differentiation_ of that feature compared to the others. _differentiation_ is the absolute difference of the average values of the feature in cases and controls.
   * _SAM rank_ is the rank of the SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) metric of the feature compared to the others.

As an example, the sequence of commands below computes the utility for a metatask output directory and shows the first lines of the output file.

{{{

openbiomind/classes $ head outputs/utest.txt

Gory details:

   * Feature descriptions above are taken from the dataset itself.
   * SAM rank is calculated in a somewhat simplified way, always based on just 100 shuffles.
   * Computation time for this example is just a couple of seconds (in a G4 Mac, 1.25MHz, 768M RAM), but in a realistic experiment it could be many seconds, perhaps even over a minute. Execution time is proportional to the number of important features found in the metatask results; in this example only four important feature where found, but in some realistic experimental setups there may be thousands.

While UtilityComputer accounts the frequency of usage of genes across classification models learned from gene expression data, SNPUtilityComputer does the same for models learned from SNP data. One may wonder why a different command is necessary for dealing with SNP features when the basic principle for gauging feature utility (frequency across models) is the same. The answer for that lies in Biology: *genes* associated to important SNPs are also very important (perhaps even *more* important that its individual important SNPs, depending on the focus of the research project at hand). Therefore, SNPUtilityComputer also computes the utility of *genes* in a given MetaTask output generated from SNP data. In the case of a gene _g_, its "SNP utility" is computed as the percent of models containing SNPs belonging to _g_.


The syntax of this command is:

{{{
java task.SNPUtilityComputer <-r result dir> <-o output dir> <-d base dataset> <-m snp 2 gene file> [-targetCategory target category]
}}}

As one can see, this command takes as input a _result dir_ containing MetaTask results generated from SNP data, much like UtilityComputer. However, all other options show some degree of difference:

   * For starts, the _-o_ option specifies an output directory instead of a single file - for SNPUtilityComputer actually generates two output files, one for SNPs and the other for genes. 
   * The _-d_ option specifies a base dataset - which is generated by FoldSelectSNPs and contains the union of all SNPs and all samples present in the folds. That base dataset is used for computing differentiation and SAM, which are computed and shown together with utility for sake of comparison. In the case of gene expression data, the file equivalent to the "base dataset" usually is the dataset submitted to folding or other transformation. In the case of SNPs, since the original dataset submitted to folding is not even numeric and besides often is huge, the practical solution was to generate a numeric dataset specific for computation of SAM and differentiation.
   * Option _-m_ specifies a file containing a SNP to gene mapping. Basically, it is a tabular file containing one SNP-gene pair per line, telling the association "this SNP belongs to that gene". This file is necessary for computing utility focused on genes instead of SNPs.

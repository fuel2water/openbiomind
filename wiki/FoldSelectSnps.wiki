_FoldSelectSNPs_ is much like a version of DatasetTransformer specifically adapted to deal with SNP datasets.

SNPs, or Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms, basically represent allelic information focused of the level of individual bases instead of whole genes. A SNP value will be thus typically represented by pairs of symbols representing possible allelic pairings, for instance AA, AB and BB. Therefore, SNP data is _discrete_, in oposition to gene expression data, which is represented by continuous numeric values.

Therefore, the OpenBiomind format for SNP datasets is extremely similar to the gene expression data, with just two differences:

  * Instead of numbers values of feature x sample are pairs of characters. Character '0'  is considered special, meaning a "no call" or "indetermined" SNP.

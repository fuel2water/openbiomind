#Usage and "philosophy" of the SimpleGraph command

= Introduction =

The SimpleGraph command as added to the OpenBiomind toolkit as a simpler (and in some ways better) alternative to the original GraphFeatures command.

Utilization of GraphFeatures over many different datasets showed some difficults in usability and a tendency for producing less-than-ideal results. GraphFeatures has a relatively large number of parameters, and usually many attempts tuning those parameters are necessary until a satisfactory result is achieved. Even though, the final result often may come short of being ideal, often forcing the user to opt between a graph fully connected but not very clear due to an excess of edges, or a graph will fewer edges but on the other hand broken in several subgraphs.

SimpleGraph addresses those shortcomings by using only one parameter and leaving most of the work of producing a good-looking, clear and informative graph to internal heuristics and systematics. The philosophy and usage of the command are detailed below.

= Criteria and Solutions =

SimpleGraph was built keeping in mind the production of a good-looking, clear graph. Of course that first definition is rather vague and subjective, but the list below tries to break down in key points what defines a graph as good looking and clear:

  # The graph should be connected, i.e., with at least one path between any two pairs of nodes.
  # Edges should be kept to a minimum, avoiding the formation of a "spaguetti" graph.

SimpleGraph achieves criterion #2 as well as the requisite of simple parameters by showing just the n most co-occurring edges (as well as their corresponding nodes, of course) of the metatask result analyzed. 

That is, the number of edges is parametrized in a near-hard way. It is not a _completely_ hard way only because there may be ties among the top n most occurring edges, and so n is in fact a lower bound. Also, the larger the n, the higher-than-n will tend to be the actual number of edges.

Also, plotting only the most co-occuring edges almost always will produce a disconnected graph, violating criterion #1. Therefore, more edges are necessary for "glueing" the several independent subgraphs that usually appear under that initial approach.

The solution used here was to use co-expression edges to perform such "glueing". For a given independent subgraph A, the most co-expressive edge between a node of A and another node from one of the other subgraphs is found, until all subgraphs are united in a single connected graph.
